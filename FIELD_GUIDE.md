## Identification Fields

### 1. OptionName
**What it is**: Unique code identifying this specific put option contract
**Example**: `ERICB6U45` (Ericsson B-share, expiry code 6U, strike 45 SEK)
**Why it matters**: Use this to place orders or track specific options

### 51. StockName
**What it is**: Company name (Swedish convention, e.g., "ERIC B" for Ericsson B-shares)
**Why it matters**: Identifies which stock you're protecting

### 52. ExpiryDate
**What it is**: Last day the option is valid
**Format**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Why it matters**: After this date, option expires. Earlier dates = less time = lower premiums but faster profit

### 2. FinancialReport
**What it is**: 'Y' if company releases quarterly/annual report before expiry, empty otherwise
**Why it matters**: Reports can cause big price swings. 'Y' means higher risk but potentially higher reward

### 3. X-Day
**What it is**: 'Y' if ex-dividend date falls before expiry, empty otherwise
**Why it matters**: Stock price drops by dividend amount on ex-dividend date. Our calculations already adjust for this

---

## Pricing Fields

### 4. Premium
**What it is**: Total money you receive for selling this put option position
**Unit**: SEK (for the full position sized to ~100,000 SEK)
**Example**: Premium = 5,000 SEK means you get 5,000 SEK immediately
**Why it matters**: This is your profit if stock stays above strike price

### 28. Bid_Ask_Mid_Price
**What it is**: Average between what buyers offer (bid) and what sellers ask
**Unit**: SEK per option contract (1 contract = 100 shares)
**Why it matters**: Fair market price for one option. Used to calculate Premium field

### 29. Option_Price_Min
**What it is**: Minimum price per option to break even (accounting for transaction costs)
**Unit**: SEK per option
**Why it matters**: Only sell if market price is above this break-even point

### 30. NumberOfContractsBasedOnLimit
**What it is**: How many option contracts you'd sell for a 100,000 SEK position
**Why it matters**: All loss/premium calculations assume this position size

### 31. Bid
**What it is**: Highest price buyers are offering right now
**Unit**: SEK per option
**Why it matters**: You can sell immediately at this price (real market price)

### 53. Ask
**What it is**: Lowest price sellers are offering right now
**Unit**: SEK per option
**Why it matters**: Shows other side of market. Gap between Bid and Ask shows liquidity

### 37. AskBidSpread
**What it is**: Difference between Ask and Bid prices
**Unit**: SEK
**Why it matters**: Narrow spread (<1 SEK) = liquid, easy to trade. Wide spread (>5 SEK) = harder to get fair price

---

## Probability Fields

**Key Concept**: Higher probability = more likely option expires worthless = you keep the premium

### 8. ProbWorthless_Bayesian_IsoCal
**What it is**: Sophisticated statistical adjustment based on similar past options

**Why it matters**: Groups similar options (by probability bucket and time to expiry) and learns from outcomes

### 5. PoW_Simulation_Mean_Earnings
**What it is**: Average profit/loss from 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations
**Unit**: SEK
**Why it matters**: Simulated long-term average outcome. Positive = profitable strategy over many trades

**Why it matters**: **Strike price below this = extra safety margin**. Field #50 flags these safe options

### 25. Lower_Bound_HistMedianIV_at_Accuracy
**What it is**: Lower bound using historical median implied volatility (at 80% accuracy)
**Unit**: SEK
**Why it matters**: Alternative calculation using longer-term volatility average. More conservative estimate

### 27. Lower_Bound_HistMedianIV
**What it is**: Lower bound using historical median implied volatility (without accuracy adjustment)
**Unit**: SEK
**Why it matters**: Shows typical volatility range without accuracy weighting

### 49. ExpiryDate_Lower_Bound_Minus_Pct_Based_on_Accuracy
**What it is**: Percentage adjustment used in lower bound calculations
**Unit**: Decimal (0.35 = 35%)
**Why it matters**: Technical field showing how much volatility buffer is applied

### 50. StrikeBelowLowerAtAcc

### 24. Mean_Accuracy
**What it is**: Historical accuracy of implied volatility predictions for this stock/timeframe
**Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (0% to 100%)

## How to Use This Data for Decisions

### Conservative Strategy (High Safety)
Look for:
- **StrikeBelowLowerAtAcc** = 'Y' (strike below safe threshold)
- **1_2_3_ProbOfWorthless_Weighted** > 0.85 (>85% success probability)
- **ProfitLossPctWorst** > 0.15 (premium at least 15% of worst loss)
- **Mean_Accuracy** > 0.75 (reliable predictions)

### Balanced Strategy (Moderate Risk/Reward)
Look for:
- **1_2_3_ProbOfWorthless_Weighted** = 0.75-0.85 (75-85% probability)
- **StrikePrice** close to **Lower_Bound_at_Accuracy** (some buffer)
- **ProfitLossPctLeastBad** > 0.25 (good risk/reward)
- **FinancialReport** = empty (avoid earnings uncertainty)

### Aggressive Strategy (Higher Premiums)
Look for:
- **IV_AllMedianIV_Maximum100DaysToExp_Ratio** > 1.3 (elevated volatility)
- **1_2_3_ProbOfWorthless_Weighted** = 0.65-0.75 (still reasonable probability)
- **Premium** high relative to position size
- Accept higher **LossAtBadDecline** for better premiums

### Quick Screening
1. Start with **1_2_3_ProbOfWorthless_Weighted** (main probability)
2. Check **StrikeBelowLowerAtAcc** (safety flag)
3. Review **LossAtBadDecline** (realistic worst case)
4. Compare **Premium** vs **Loss_Least_Bad** (risk/reward)
5. Verify **AskBidSpread** < 5 SEK (liquidity)

---

## Important Concepts

### All Dollar Amounts Are for ~100,000 SEK Position
- Premium, losses, and underlying values assume you're sizing position to ~100k SEK
- NumberOfContractsBasedOnLimit shows how many contracts this means
- Scale up/down proportionally for different position sizes

### Negative Numbers = Losses
- All "Loss" fields are negative numbers
- More negative = bigger loss
- Example: -20,000 = you lose 20,000 SEK

### Transaction Costs Included
- 150 SEK courtage (brokerage fee) is already deducted from all loss calculations
- Premium and losses are net of fees

### Probabilities Are Estimates
- Based on mathematical models and historical data
- Not guarantees
- Use Mean_Accuracy field to gauge reliability

### Historical Scenarios
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- But shows what's possible
- 2008 scenarios = extreme stress test
